first, the sinner shall
fail from a charging explosion
within the basement

second, the prostiture shall
fall to a misplaced explosive
below the basement

third, satan's left hand man
shall be betrayed by his mother

fourth, the demon shall be betrayed
by his master down below

don't feel lonely, there's
plenty of flies down here!

never look below the top

be careful of the flames;
they attract demons

the soulless will
never let you go

he rules us all anyways;
why even try?

pain drives us to do
stupid things sometimes

loss drives us to give
up, so don't lose!

the sinner shall die in there!
he cannot breathe!

give her a second chance;
good may come from it

give him a second chance;
good may come from it

the soulless knows betrayal
like the back of its hand

the soulless never really
wanted to hurt you; 
all it wanted was a friend!

friends are all you have
in this life

death is not an end;
it is only the beginning!

never hold on for more
than a day or two;
the pain will stay

the soulless needs a new
friend's soul to care for;
it doesn't have one

the demon from the flames
shall kill you on it's
unholy throne of fire!

the angel from above
shall kill you on it's
sacred throne of light!

beware the angels who
have fallen

the story's about to
start, gather round
the campfire!

the soulless used to
have a soul, you know?

but then it lost it
somehow

nothing really worked
for it, as it slowly
fell into the darkness

it tried friendship,
but it didn't work out
because of it's issues

it tried pain,
but that only scared
it's friends away

it thought that the
pain would've helped
it live through it

but all pain did was
ruin it's life

...please listen to it

it wants to have you
as a friend

it needs friends,
because of its
loneliness

without them, it falls
apart because of it

it tried everything,
but they still stayed
away from it

nothing really worked,
so it fell to the
bottom of the world

and from it's grave, 
it rules all above
and below it

but it still feels it.

the pain drives it
to do horrible things
to good people

friends will give it
a meaning and make it
better

so please, just be it's
friend for once.

that's all it's asking for

listen to it's words when 
it wants you to be
it's friend for the day

because it's only other
friend is it's shadows

shadows rule the world

pain hides in the eyes
of our shadows

the shadows give it to
us, willingly

but we try to hide it
deep inside, so we think
we're doing fine

when really, we're
fighting to stay alive
with or without the pain

nothing else really
matters to us

as long as we're fine,
the world can burn

nothing else really,
truly matters...

so please,
be it's friend.
okay?

don't be lost within
yourself, alright?

...end of story

read the fortunes!

leave them alone!

fight for them!

ready for some fun?!

ready for some pain?!

go away, stop bothering me!

please stop talking

stop wasting your time here!

the clock is ticking!

once the clock hits 20,
you better be there!

The snake's tongue is
what you have

Maybe this time?

Maybe next time

It's okay, he'll be fine!

The story of the cards is
a brutal one

Do you love meh?

Run from your nightmares,
you little pussycat!

Embrace your nightmares,
soldier. They're
all you got.

6 foot, 7 foot,
8 foot, hike!

Get off of that pedestal!

Play nice!

We'll all die someday

The legacy shall live on!

15 hundred hearts are all
you need to survive

Godmode Obtained!

Stop, hammertime!

Fetus knows best!
